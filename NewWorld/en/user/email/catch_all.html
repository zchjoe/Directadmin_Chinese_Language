LANG_SET_CATCH=Set Catch All E-Mail
LANG_CATCHALL_DISABLED=Catch-All Email addresses have been disabled on this account.
LANG_THIS_EMAIL=This e-mail address will catch all improperly addressed mail (i.e. to a user that doesn't exist) to your site.  This address may be your defaultusername@yourdomain.com, or any other POP3 account you have created.
LANG_FAIL=Fail:
LANG_SENDER=The sender is notified that the address doesn't exist <b>(recommended)</b>
LANG_FAIL_EXPLANATION=This is the recommended option for the catch-all setting.  Catch-all's will increase the server load due to spam, so having them disable is highly recommended unless you absolutely need the feature on.
LANG_IGNORE=Ignore:
LANG_DROPPED=The email is dropped and completely ignored <a href="javascript:alert('|LANG_DROPPED_EXPLANATION|');"><b>(not recommended)</b></a>
LANG_DROPPED_EXPLANATION=Avoid using the Ignore option unless you know what you are doing.  Spammers will be sending you emails to random addresses, and this option will accept those emails.  You will not know it because the accepted emails would be discarded.  This greatly increases the server load unnecessarily.  If you do not want the catch-all to be on, then use the Fail option instead.
LANG_ADDR=Address:
LANG_UPDATE=Update
